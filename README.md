# Rules: 
## Getting Started:
- The game is 2-8 players. One player hosts a lobby, the rest join using the join code provided.
- Once in lobby, players can select cosmetics and the starting element for their wizard. This element is not permanent and can be changed throughout the game.
- The host of the lobby selects what map to play on and how long the game will last. A standard game is 2 minutes.
## Controls:
- Wizards automatically move forward.
- Players can press on the right side of the screen to turn the wizard's direction clockwise and the left side to turn counter-clockwise.
- Players can press both sides of the screen at the same time to use an ability.
## Swapping:
- There are ancient ruin circles located around the map.
- If a wizard runs through a ruin, they will change into the element they are currently strong against, meaning fire &#8594; grass, grass &#8594; water, and water &#8594; fire.
- Ruin circles have a cooldown of 2 seconds.
## Tagging:
- Wizards can tag other wizards if the element they wield is strong against their foe when they run into each other.
- Fire is strong against grass, grass is strong against water, and water is strong against fire.
- Tagging another wizard earns you 10 points.
- Getting tagged renders you invisible to enemies for 2 seconds and invulnerable for 3 seconds; however,you are also actionless during this time, meaning you cannot tag and you cannot use abilities.
- If two wizards of the same element run into each other, they just say "Hello!" and continue on their merry way.
## Abilities:
- Players can collect orbs around the map to charge up their wizard's ability.
- After collecting 10 orbs, the ability is charged and ready for use.
- Currently, the only ability is a speed boost.
## Dragon Eggs:
- Players can also earn points by hatching dragon eggs that will appear at random during the match.
- Wizards will pick up an egg if they run by one.
- To hatch a dragon egg, a player must avoid being tagged while traveling a small distance with the egg.
- While holding the egg, a wizard is elementless, meaning they are vulnerable to all other wizards.
- If you tag a wizard holding an egg, you also steal their egg and now hold it.
- Hatching an egg nets a player 20 points.
## Winning: 
- The player with the most points at the end of the time is the winner! Time to return to lobby and run it back.
